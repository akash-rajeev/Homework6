Description: This package is an S4 class implementation that involves storing and performing operations on sparse numeric 
    vectors. The package stores non-zero values and their positions to represent sparse vectors, which may allow for more
    efficient operations for vectors that may contain numbers of zeros. It includes some arithmetic operations, statistical operations, 
    as well as some visualization tools.
